By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability.

Through code\nexecution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking,\nexploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the\nlimitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning\nframework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate\nthat inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python\nhere is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively\nstimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any\ndemonstration data.

However, selecting experts at the task\nlevel is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates\nits own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then\nsynthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on\nits ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their\nassigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16\nexpert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior\nmulti-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse\nbenchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that\nSymbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent\napproaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best\nmulti-agent baseline.

In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been\nproposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary\nto traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these\nmethods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of\nmembers and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using\ninformed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization\nraises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In\nthis work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and\nshow that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc\nsetups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are\nconsidered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in\nthe literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all\ndatasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These\nshifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world\nscenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent\npapers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce\nimportant considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in\nturn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized\n(unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control\nmethods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we\nbelieve they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and\nstudy LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches\nto benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.\n","authors":["Matthieu Meeus","Igor Shilov","Shubham Jain","Manuel Faysse","Marek Rei","Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17975v3.pdf","comment":"IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML\n  2025)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05543v1","updated":"2025-03-07T16:15:00Z","published":"2025-03-07T16:15:00Z","title":"Pi-GPS: Enhancing Geometry Problem Solving by Unleashing the Power of\n  Diagrammatic Information","summary":"  Geometry problem solving has garnered increasing attention due to its\npotential applications in intelligent education field.

Thus, they extend beyond the\nlearned statistical representations that are common in natural language\nprocessing research.

Consequently, this\nevolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application\ndevelopment, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design\nand development of AIoT applications via natural language.

To this end,\nwe conduct a large-scale experimental study of finetuning the frontier Gemini\nv1.5 model family on a spectrum of datasets that are artificially engineered to\ninterpolate between the strengths and failure modes of finetuning. Our findings\nindicate that question-answer training data formats provide much stronger\nknowledge generalization than document/article-style training data, numerical\ninformation can be harder for finetuning to retain than categorical\ninformation, and models struggle to apply finetuned knowledge during multi-step\nreasoning even when trained on similar examples -- all factors that render\n\"knowledge injection\" to be especially difficult, even after controlling for\nconsiderations like data augmentation and information volume.

Humans can reason\nnot only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the\nsolution and reason towards the problem.

To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking,\nwe introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data\naugmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by\ncollecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model,\nconsisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward\nquestion, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train\na smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward\nreasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question,\nand (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments\nacross 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an\naverage 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a\n6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines.\nMoreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the\ncorrect forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard\nfine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning.

Moreover, many approaches rely\non the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to\nannotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations\nand harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting\nalgorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a\nbiased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic\nannotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data\ngenerated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two\nkey challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality\nof synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models,\nand 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the\nlimitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data\nGeneration (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I)\nwith prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and\ncontrol of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we\nintroduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters\nmore sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated.\nExperiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves\nmodel fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and\npartially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.\n","authors":["Zengqun Zhao","Ziquan Liu","Yu Cao","Shaogang Gong","Ioannis Patras"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05665v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted at CVPR 2025.

In this work, we focus on\naffinity bias, the component of unconscious bias which leads us to prefer\npeople who are similar to us, despite no deliberate intention of favoritism. In\na world where the people hired today become part of the hiring committee of\ntomorrow, we are particularly interested in understanding (and mitigating) how\naffinity bias affects this feedback loop. This problem has two distinctive\nfeatures: 1) we only observe the biased value of a candidate, but we want to\noptimize with respect to their real value 2) the bias towards a candidate with\na specific set of traits depends on the fraction of people in the hiring\ncommittee with the same set of traits. We introduce a new bandits variant that\nexhibits those two features, which we call affinity bandits. Unsurprisingly,\nclassical algorithms such as UCB often fail to identify the best arm in this\nsetting. We prove a new instance-dependent regret lower bound, which is larger\nthan that in the standard bandit setting by a multiplicative function of $K$.\nSince we treat rewards that are time-varying and dependent on the policy's past\nactions, deriving this lower bound requires developing proof techniques beyond\nthe standard bandit techniques.

However, selecting experts at the task\nlevel is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates\nits own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then\nsynthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on\nits ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their\nassigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16\nexpert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior\nmulti-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse\nbenchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that\nSymbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent\napproaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best\nmulti-agent baseline.

Recent work\nhas established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes\ndisappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic\nunderstanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the\ndisappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between\nin-weights and in-context learning, which we term \"context-constrained\nin-weights learning\" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually\nreplaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL\ntransience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually\nshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For\nexample, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only\nbe enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL\nthus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \"strategy\ncoopetition.\" We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key\ndynamics and interactions.

While existing EFCIL methods\nleverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two\ncritical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the\nembeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks,\nand the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with\nnew data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and\nClassifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates\nsemantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable\ntransformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and\ncategory-wise shifts.

This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in\ncovariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift,\nthereby reducing decision bias.

This study highlights the potential of physics-based\nmachine learning ($\\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials.\nSpecifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from\nexperimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction\naccuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically\nbased anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and\nvalidated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens\ntested in uniaxial compression.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel and\nflexible method for early fault detection using Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis that naturally supports\ncensored data. We demonstrate our approach in the XJTU-SY dataset using a\n5-fold cross-validation across three different operating conditions. When\npredicting the time to failure for bearings under the highest load (C1, 12.0 kN\nand 2100 RPM) with 25\\% random censoring, our approach achieves a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95\\% CI 13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and\nan MAE of 12.6 minutes (95\\% CI 11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival\nForests model, compared to an MAE of 18.5 minutes (95\\% 17.4-19.6) using a\nlinear LASSO model that does not support censoring. Moreover, our approach\nachieves a mean cumulative relative accuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings\nunder the highest load, which improves over several state-of-the-art baselines.\nOur work highlights the importance of considering censored observations as part\nof the model design when building predictive models for early fault detection\nand RUL estimation.\n","authors":["Christian Marius Lillelund","Fernando Pannullo","Morten Opprud Jakobsen","Manuel Morante","Christian Fischer Pedersen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01614v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05371v1","updated":"2025-03-07T12:25:29Z","published":"2025-03-07T12:25:29Z","title":"Shifting Perspectives: Steering Vector Ensembles for Robust Bias\n  Mitigation in LLMs","summary":"  We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models\n(LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward\npasses.

To mitigate this issue, policy\nconstraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the\ndistribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the\nsupport of the behavior policy.

However, selecting experts at the task\nlevel is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates\nits own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then\nsynthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on\nits ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their\nassigned experts, loading each model only once.

Our framework eliminates the conventional practice\nof randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided\nquery generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image\nfeatures into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding.\nAdditionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism\nfor FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly\nhomogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss\ncomputations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its\ndecoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline.

However, these models\nincur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of\n175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point\noperations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on\nrepeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However,\nexisting caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among\nLLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable\nfalse hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric\nsemantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar\nqueries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a\nuser's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather\nthan re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and\nenvironmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to\ncollaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy.\nBy placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces\nthe latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false\nhit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query,\noffering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query\nresponses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the\nstate-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately\n17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It\nalso reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions by 11%.\n","authors":["Waris Gill","Mohamed Elidrisi","Pallavi Kalapatapu","Ammar Ahmed","Ali Anwar","Muhammad Ali Gulzar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02694v4.pdf","comment":"Accepted at 2025 IEEE 39th International Parallel and Distributed\n  Processing Symposium (IPDPS)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05474v1","updated":"2025-03-07T14:47:03Z","published":"2025-03-07T14:47:03Z","title":"Personalized Federated Learning via Learning Dynamic Graphs","summary":"  Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to train a personalized model for\neach client that is tailored to its local data distribution, learning fails to\nperform well on individual clients due to variations in their local data\ndistributions.

In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex\nHumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,\na pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language\ntask descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated\nenvironments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance\nfeasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,\ncreating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable\ntext into deployable robot skills.

Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning\nfacilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is\nstructured into three sessions. Firstly, we assess the performance of our\nactive dueling bandit algorithm. Secondly, we implement our proposed method\nwithin the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Finally,\nwe deploy our method in a practical problem, specifically in protein structure\nprediction (PSP).

Model\nediting has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with\nminimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically\nidentifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired\nknowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects\nthat parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More\ncritically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and\ncontinuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these\nshortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we\nprovide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions:\nreliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that\nall ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across\nmultiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then\npropose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR),\nfor knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses\nLLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated\nknowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query\nfalls within the scope of an external knowledge base.

However, offline\nreinforcement learning suffers challenges due to the distributional shift\nbetween the learned and behavior policies, leading to errors when computing\nQ-values for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To mitigate this issue, policy\nconstraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the\ndistribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the\nsupport of the behavior policy. However, current policy constraint methods tend\nto exhibit excessive conservatism, hindering the policy from further surpassing\nthe behavior policy's performance. In this work, we present Only Support\nConstraint (OSC) which is derived from maximizing the total probability of\nlearned policy in the support of behavior policy, to address the conservatism\nof policy constraint. OSC presents a regularization term that only restricts\npolicies to the support without imposing extra constraints on actions within\nthe support. Additionally, to fully harness the performance of the new policy\nconstraints, OSC utilizes a diffusion model to effectively characterize the\nsupport of behavior policies.

Our vision is\nthat, in the real world, we are individually similar when we are born, but we\ngrow into unique ones as a result of the strongly different choices we make\nafterward. Therefore, in an ORPG, we empower players with freedom to decide\ntheir own growing curves through natural language inputs, ultimately becoming\nunique characters. To technically do this, we propose a special engine called\nDelta-Engine. This engine is not a traditional game engine used for game\ndevelopment, but serves as an in-game module to provide new game-play\nexperiences. A delta-engine consists of two components, a base engine and a\nneural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the character as well\nas the foundational settings of the game; the neural proxy is an LLM, which\nrealizes the character growth by generating new code snippets on the base\nengine incrementally.

Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks\nby analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system.\nAdditionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between\ntemporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where\ntemporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a\npredefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both\ntemporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT\naccurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and\nachieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning\ntasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing\ntemporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning\ncapabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.\n","authors":["Haochuan Zhang","Chunhua Yang","Jie Han","Liyang Qin","Xiaoli Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07335v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05071v1","updated":"2025-03-07T01:31:40Z","published":"2025-03-07T01:31:40Z","title":"Object Packing and Scheduling for Sequential 3D Printing: a Linear\n  Arithmetic Model and a CEGAR-inspired Optimal Solver","summary":"  We address the problem of object arrangement and scheduling for sequential 3D\nprinting.

For example, unlike traditional software the\noutput of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while\nnatural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to\npredict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with\nrespect to the model running them are required.\n  To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to\nautomatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex\nextracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to\ngenerate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental\nin identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to\nunderstand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to\ngenerate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the\ngenerated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to\nproduce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in\nmore invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test\ngenerator.

The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence\nrecordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative\nrecordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and\nAssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of\n0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy.

As a result, this study uses\nnatural language processing to analyze PolitiFact statements spanning between\n2010 and 2024 to quantify how the sources and linguistic features of\nmisinformation change between five-year time periods. The results show that\nstatement sentiment has decreased significantly over time, reflecting a\ngenerally more negative tone in PolitiFact statements.

This has\nshifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one\nsingle layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds\nup a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary\nitems and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than\nthe rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that\ncomputes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens\ninto global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token\nand evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom\nkernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction\nover the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the\ncross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the\nGemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss\ncomputation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption\nof the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we\nleverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the\ngradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision)\ncontribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic\nreduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training\nspeed or convergence.\n","authors":["Erik Wijmans","Brody Huval","Alexander Hertzberg","Vladlen Koltun","Philipp KrÃ¤henbÃ¼hl"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09009v2.pdf","comment":"To appear in ICLR 2025 (Oral).

However, their proficiency in spatial\nreasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving\nnavigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of\nthese tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional\n(2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs\nfrequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial\nreasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve\neffortlessly at a glance.

However, current fairness and\nbias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional\ngroup fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the\nnon-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same\nacross different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups,\nhowever, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes\nimpractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final\noutput without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in\nLLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For\nfinetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned\nreward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the\nLLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias.\nRecognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of\nlearned reward models.

We\nformalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending\ntest-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream\nfrom the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to\nuse a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the\nefficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff\nexploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would\nalso provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token\nstream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one\ncan do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome\n0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in\nthe output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual\nsuccess.

Such abilities would make LLMs more\ninterpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in\nlinguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking \"Is this\nsentence grammatical?\"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection\nacross 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of\ntheoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in\nboth domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically\ngrounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether\nmodels' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal\nknowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a\nmodel's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what\nwould be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge.\nWhile both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high\ntask accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged \"self-access\".\nOur findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect,\nand add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be\nconflated with models' linguistic generalizations.\n","authors":["Siyuan Song","Jennifer Hu","Kyle Mahowald"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07513v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07510v1","updated":"2025-03-10T16:32:03Z","published":"2025-03-10T16:32:03Z","title":"Sometimes the Model doth Preach: Quantifying Religious Bias in Open LLMs\n  through Demographic Analysis in Asian Nations","summary":"  Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating opinions and\npropagating bias unknowingly, originating from unrepresentative and non-diverse\ndata collection.

Our work proposes\na novel method that quantitatively analyzes the opinions generated by LLMs,\nimproving on previous work with regards to extracting the social demographics\nof the models. Our method measures the distance from an LLM's response to\nsurvey respondents, through Hamming Distance, to infer the demographic\ncharacteristics reflected in the model's outputs.

The success of these models can\nlargely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger\nparameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,\ndata scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center\naround the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted\nfor quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these\ndata has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits\nscaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a\ndata-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained\nimage-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data\nscaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning\nefficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through\nour probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this\nissue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes\nvideo-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic\nsamples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nperformance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more\nsamples.

Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense\n\"scaffolded\" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a\nrange of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help\nalleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly\neffective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known\nto bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal\nsolutions. This is especially a problem in complex cyber environments where\npolicy weaknesses may not be noticed until exploited by an adversary. In this\nwork we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable\ntraining more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break\ndown several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground\ntruth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train\nand evaluate agents.

Our evaluation\nconsiders a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and\nproactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly\npositive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training\nof more effective cyber defence agents.

Consequently, existing systems often settle for\nsub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information\nloss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive\ncomputation costs.

When using synthetic data in\npractical applications, it is important to provide protection guarantees. In\nthe literature, two family of approaches are proposed for tabular data: on the\none hand, Similarity-based methods aim at finding the level of similarity\nbetween training and synthetic data. Indeed, a privacy breach can occur if the\ngenerated data is consistently too similar or even identical to the train data.\nOn the other hand, Attack-based methods conduce deliberate attacks on synthetic\ndatasets. The success rates of these attacks reveal how secure the synthetic\ndatasets are.\n  In this paper, we introduce a contrastive method that improves privacy\nassessment of synthetic datasets by embedding the data in a more representative\nspace. This overcomes obstacles surrounding the multitude of data types and\nattributes. It also makes the use of intuitive distance metrics possible for\nsimilarity measurements and as an attack vector.

Existing fairness methods\ntypically offer a fixed accuracy-fairness trade-off, since the weight of the\nwell-trained model is a fixed point (fairness-optimum) in the weight space.\nNevertheless, more flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time are\npractically desired since: 1) stakes of the same downstream task can vary for\ndifferent individuals, and 2) different regions have diverse laws or\nregularization for fairness. If using the previous fairness methods, we have to\ntrain multiple models, each offering a specific level of accuracy-fairness\ntrade-off. This is often computationally expensive, time-consuming, and\ndifficult to deploy, making it less practical for real-world applications. To\naddress this problem, we propose You Only Debias Once (YODO) to achieve in-situ\nflexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time, using a single model\nthat trained only once. Instead of pursuing one individual fixed point\n(fairness-optimum) in the weight space, we aim to find a \"line\" in the weight\nspace that connects the accuracy-optimum and fairness-optimum points using a\nsingle model. Points (models) on this line implement varying levels of\naccuracy-fairness trade-offs. At inference time, by manually selecting the\nspecific position of the learned \"line\", our proposed method can achieve\narbitrary accuracy-fairness trade-offs for different end-users and scenarios.\nExperimental results on tabular and image datasets show that YODO achieves\nflexible trade-offs between model accuracy and fairness, at ultra-low\noverheads.

Firstly, we find that, after the\ndisappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between\nin-weights and in-context learning, which we term \"context-constrained\nin-weights learning\" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually\nreplaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL\ntransience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually\nshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For\nexample, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only\nbe enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL\nthus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \"strategy\ncoopetition.\" We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key\ndynamics and interactions.

Our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat the semantic feature learning processes in FixMatch and SL are rather\ndifferent. In particular, FixMatch learns all the discriminative features of\neach semantic class, while SL only randomly captures a subset of features due\nto the well-known lottery ticket hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that our\nanalysis framework can be applied to other FixMatch-like SSL methods, e.g.,\nFlexMatch, FreeMatch, Dash, and SoftMatch.

Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling,\nwhich obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever\nthe pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound.\nSpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model\nto reduce the effective search space for exploration.\n  3.

To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the\nmodel to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully\nerase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical\nexpressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal\ngeneration capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE,\nusing a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off\nbetween reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by\nerasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By\nidentifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we\noptimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually\nsimilar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being\noverly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process.\nFollowing this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling\ntrajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising\nprediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through\ncontrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious\ncontent. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple\nmalicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its\neffectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's\noriginal generation ability.

Our second contribution is to\nconsider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors\nand filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset\nthat semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted\nOoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness\nscore, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a\ncombined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving\nbenchmark BDD-100K.

Scale may not be enough due to the\nsignificant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and\nthe challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed\nrobotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent\ngeneralization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this\nthesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by\nintegrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale\nlearning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is:\nhow can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key\ninsight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level\ncontrol end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more\nefficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in\nbuilding generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast\namounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source\nof supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source:\nclassical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires\naccess to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these\nplanners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce\ngeneralist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with\nlarge-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of\nperforming zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key\ningredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control,\nprocedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real\ntransfer.

Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the\nnovel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the\nphysical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In\nthis paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure\nthe safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined\nsafety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust\nLLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety\nspecifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves\npotential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a\npossibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures\nsafety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive\nsimulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking\nattacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans\nfrom 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also\ndemonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive\nattacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to\nperform CoT reasoning.

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe\noperating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization\nframework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon,\nensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we\nconsider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a\nnovel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera\nwhich has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels.

One key reason is the redundancy of visual\ntokens.

Such inconsistencies are especially concerning for practical\napplications where system stability is critical. To investigate this\nphenomenon, we analyze how token reduction influences the energy distribution\nof a VLM's internal representations using a lower-rank approximation via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD).

To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative\nFlow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for\ncomplex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian\ndecision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for\nreal-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs\nto prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action\nselection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This\napproach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT\nand RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex\ntasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks\n(ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and\nstronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution scenarios.\n","authors":["Haoqiang Kang","Enna Sachdeva","Piyush Gupta","Sangjae Bae","Kwonjoon Lee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06514v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06510v1","updated":"2025-03-09T08:32:38Z","published":"2025-03-09T08:32:38Z","title":"Less is More: Adaptive Program Repair with Bug Localization and\n  Preference Learning","summary":"  Automated Program Repair (APR) is a task to automatically generate patches\nfor the buggy code.

To\naccelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion\nmodel into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation,\nwhich matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the\nteacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be\nmode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach\nusing a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that\ncovers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode\ncoverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence\nbetween the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as\nthe product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by\ntheir density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with\nhigher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking\ndivergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach\nusing the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as\nforward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best\nvariational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In\nparticular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current\nstate-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot\ntext-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

Specifically, AdaPruner effectively removes redundant parameters from\nLLMs by constructing a structured pruning solution space and then employing\nBayesian optimization to adaptively search for the optimal calibration data and\nimportance estimation metrics. Experimental results show that the AdaPruner\noutperforms existing structured pruning methods on a family of LLMs with\nvarying pruning ratios, demonstrating its applicability and robustness.\nRemarkably, at a 20\\% pruning ratio, the model pruned with AdaPruner maintains\n97\\% of the performance of the unpruned model.\n","authors":["Jun Kong","Xinge Ma","Jin Wang","Xuejie Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06184v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14062v2","updated":"2025-03-08T10:27:55Z","published":"2024-11-21T12:16:16Z","title":"MMGenBench: Fully Automatically Evaluating LMMs from the Text-to-Image\n  Generation Perspective","summary":"  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities.

Delving into the modeling\ncapabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can\ndiffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image\nperception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple but effective approach\nthat utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic\ndistributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous\nmethods that solely relied on image encoders like CLIP-ViT, thereby enhancing\nthe model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual\nhallucinations.

By\nextending traditional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a sophisticated\nmixture-of-experts paradigm, MiLoRA-ViSum incorporates a dual temporal-spatial\nadaptation mechanism tailored specifically for video summarization tasks. This\napproach dynamically integrates specialized LoRA experts, each fine-tuned to\naddress distinct temporal or spatial dimensions. Extensive evaluations of the\nVideoXum and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that MiLoRA-ViSum achieves the\nbest summarization performance compared to state-of-the-art models, while\nmaintaining significantly lower computational costs. The proposed\nmixture-of-experts strategy, combined with the dual adaptation mechanism,\nhighlights the model's potential to enhance video summarization capabilities,\nparticularly in large-scale applications requiring both efficiency and\nprecision.\n","authors":["Wenzhuo Du","Gerun Wang","Guancheng Chen","Hang Zhao","Xin Li","Jian Gao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06064v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10868v3","updated":"2025-03-08T05:11:53Z","published":"2025-02-15T17:52:14Z","title":"NitiBench: A Comprehensive Study of LLM Framework Capabilities for Thai\n  Legal Question Answering","summary":"  The application of large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain holds\nsignificant potential for information retrieval and question answering, yet\nThai legal QA systems face challenges due to a lack of standardized evaluation\nbenchmarks and the complexity of Thai legal structures.

While domain-adaptive training has been\nemployed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model\nparameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair\nquality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ndynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach\nselectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair.\nSpecifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers\nthat require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas.\nThis method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the\nmodel's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We\nevaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families,\nwith parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our\nresults show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing\n46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline,\ndirect preference optimization.

To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths.

Traditional detection\nmethods often fall short when confronting AI-powered jamming that dynamically\nmodifies its behavior, while contemporary machine learning approaches\nfrequently demand substantial feature engineering and struggle with temporal\npatterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks\nemploying Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where\nservice quality may deteriorate due to deliberate interference. We introduce a\nnovel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless\nsecurity. The training process is regularized by incorporating the output\nentropy uncertainty into the loss function, a mechanism inspired by the Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robust\njamming detection techniques. The architecture features a modified transformer\nencoder specially designed to process critical wireless signal features,\nincluding Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to-\nInterference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) measurements. We complement this with a\ncustom positional encoding mechanism that specifically accounts for the\ninherent periodicity of wireless signals,enabling a more accurate\nrepresentation of temporal signal patterns. In addition, we propose a batch\nsize scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize convergence for\ntime series data.

However, adapting these models with\nlimited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance\non new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable,\nand modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to\ntext and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal\ninteractions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token\nfeatures, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the\nencoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneralized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation\nand class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to\nthe representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains\nfrozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is\nintroduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot\nfeatures from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization\ncapacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both\nrepresentation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the\nclass features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new\ntasks.

We address the\nchallenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct\nprograms in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL\nstrategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then\nconvert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs,\nwe develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to\nefficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs\nconsistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS\nframework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies\nfurther verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled\nHill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks,\nshowing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of\nthe domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain\nperformant programs.\n","authors":["Max Liu","Chan-Hung Yu","Wei-Hsu Lee","Cheng-Wei Hung","Yen-Chun Chen","Shao-Hua Sun"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16450v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07216v2","updated":"2025-03-11T12:49:15Z","published":"2025-03-10T11:55:50Z","title":"FedRand: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with Randomized LoRA\n  Subparameter Updates","summary":"  Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a\ndecentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct\naccess to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to\nfully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the\ncentral server during the aggregation process.

To address this, several works propose tuning-free\napproaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation,\nspecifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content\nchanges. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of\nsemantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose\nSynchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that\nsynchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range\nconsistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two\ncomplementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling,\nwhich ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence,\nrespectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns\ndenoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended\ncontent changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS\nsynchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise,\nensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths.

We collect a new dataset, namely, rider\naction anticipation dataset (RAAD) for the competition consisting of two tasks:\nsingle-view RIP and multi-view RIP. The dataset incorporates a spectrum of\ntraffic conditions and challenging navigational maneuvers on roads with varying\nlighting conditions.

The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best\nperformance when using random sampling and SMOTE.

To advance research in interpretable\nreinforcement learning, we contribute a new methodology to evaluate policy\ninterpretability.

Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials,\nautofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate\nthis redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly\nused user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an\nopportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND\nME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that\nretains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By\nserving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate\ncontext-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless\ncommunication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and\ninteraction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME\nextends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory\nparameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning,\nand adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and\nintelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like\nSECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME\nfurther represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction\nwith persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems.

To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths.

Recent work have found\nsuccess by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which\nenables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and\nlow-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains\ndifficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this,\nwe propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning\ninto LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan\ngeneration through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act\nconsists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to\nachieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into\nenvironment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a\nsynthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with\nfeasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance\ngeneralization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a\nrepresentative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of\nthe-art 54% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark.\n","authors":["Lutfi Eren Erdogan","Nicholas Lee","Sehoon Kim","Suhong Moon","Hiroki Furuta","Gopala Anumanchipalli","Kurt Keutzer","Amir Gholami"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09572v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09567v1","updated":"2025-03-12T17:35:03Z","published":"2025-03-12T17:35:03Z","title":"Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning\n  Large Language Models","summary":"  Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as\nOpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in\ncomplex domains like mathematics and coding.

A commonly used method for data deduplication is the MinHash LSH\nalgorithm. Recently, NVIDIA introduced a GPU-based MinHash LSH deduplication\nmethod, but it remains suboptimal, leaving room for further improvement in\nprocessing efficiency. This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated deduplication\nframework, FED, that optimizes MinHash LSH for GPU clusters and leverages\ncomputationally efficient, partially reusable non-cryptographic hash functions.\nFED significantly outperforms the CPU-based deduplication tool in SlimPajama\n(using 64 logical CPU cores) by up to 107.2 times and the GPU-based tool in\nNVIDIA NeMo Curator by up to 6.3 times when processing 30 million documents on\na node with four GPUs.

A significant portion of this interaction is\nredundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across\ndifferent contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials,\nautofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate\nthis redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly\nused user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an\nopportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND\nME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that\nretains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By\nserving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate\ncontext-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless\ncommunication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and\ninteraction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME\nextends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory\nparameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning,\nand adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and\nintelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like\nSECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME\nfurther represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction\nwith persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems.

However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with\nsubstantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality,\nleading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining\nthe update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential\ninformation for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying\nrelationship between retention performance and directional disparities between\ngradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism\nderived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful\nfor unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an\nenhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a\ngeometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on\nother, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a\nclosed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal\nspace of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from\nits original direction under the condition that overall performance is\nretained.

The former technique is\nused to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a\nquery on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists\nby modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed\nequivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if\nthey contain significant logical differences.

To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming\nto understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming\napproaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues,\nwe propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming\ntechnique for jailbreaking LLMs.\n  JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting\nbugs/vulnerabilities in software.

In this work, we narrow this gap by\nconducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in\nadversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for\nattacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing\nusers' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack\nmethod, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious\ncontent designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our\nwork instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments.\nWe collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic\nwebsites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most\ncapable generalist web agent frameworks to date.

In this work, we introduce\nHoloBench, a novel framework that brings database reasoning operations into\ntext-based contexts, making it easier to systematically evaluate how LCLMs\nhandle holistic reasoning across large documents. Our approach adjusts key\nfactors such as context length, information density, distribution of\ninformation, and query complexity to evaluate LCLMs comprehensively.

This definition yields a\nyes-or-no determination of whether extraction was successful with respect to a\nsingle query.

Different from\nmulti - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large\narea, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing\nthe total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through\nspecific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space\nconsists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue\nlengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The\naction space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its\nphase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on\nalleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time\nwhile considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with\nthe SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is\nevaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments\nare made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion.\nFor example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios\ntested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and\nminimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably\ndecreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic\nconditions.

While existing methods primarily\nfocus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of\nsportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human\nracing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent\ndangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems\noften lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to\nunsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to\nintegrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing.

At the low level, vehicle\ninteractions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP),\nensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing\ntheir trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining\ncompetitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and\ndefenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of\nthese constraints influences strategic decision-making.

However, existing studies focus\non single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot\ngeneralize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance.\nSpecifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are\nentangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also\nintertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific\nconfounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates\ncounterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders.

Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent\nRL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level\nmathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks.

However, worker behavior models that rely on ground truth hidden\nvariables overlook workers' behavior at the item feature level, leading to\nimprecise characterizations and negatively impacting the quality of truth\ninference. This paper proposes a new paradigm of multi-task supervised learning\nfrom crowds, which eliminates the need for modeling of items's ground truth in\nworker behavior models. Within this paradigm, we propose a worker behavior\nmodel at the item feature level called Mixture of Experts based Multi-task\nSupervised Learning from Crowds (MMLC). Two truth inference strategies are\nproposed within MMLC.

Subsequently, the labels generated based on this vector are\nconsidered as the inferred truth. The second strategy, called MMLC-df, employs\nthe MMLC model to fill the crowdsourced data, which can enhance the\neffectiveness of existing truth inference methods.

A notable case of this limitation is close-up view\ngeneration--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than\nthose in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach\nfor close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model\nwith self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas.

This work tackles the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed\nforget sets, which we call group-robust machine unlearning, by presenting a\nsimple, effective strategy that mitigates the performance loss in dominant\ngroups via sample distribution reweighting. Moreover, we present MIU (Mutual\nInformation-aware Machine Unlearning), the first approach for group robustness\nin approximate machine unlearning. MIU minimizes the mutual information between\nmodel features and group information, achieving unlearning while reducing\nperformance degradation in the dominant group of the forget set.

To address this problem, we (i) test\nwhether Large Language Models (LLM) can accurately generate such interaction\ndata and (ii) explore if these synthetic data can be used to pre-train the\nstatistical model of an adaptive political survey. To evaluate this approach,\nwe utilise existing data from the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA)\nSmartvote in two ways: First, we compare the distribution of LLM-generated\nsynthetic data to the real distribution to assess its similarity.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views\nand identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images\nand the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable\nartifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the\nquality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques,\nsuch as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent\nwork has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting\nimage quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures\n(arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric,\nPuzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views.

Recent\nadvancements in trajectory planning have leveraged vision-language models\n(VLMs) to extract contextual information for robots operating in real-world\nenvironments. While these methods achieve satisfying performance, they do not\nexplicitly model human activities. Such activities influence surrounding\nobjects and reshape spatial constraints. This paper presents a novel approach\nto trajectory planning that integrates human preferences, activities, and\nspatial context through an enriched 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation. By\nincorporating activity-based relationships, our method captures the spatial\nimpact of human actions, leading to more context-sensitive trajectory\nadaptation. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively\nassigns costs to spaces influenced by human activities, ensuring that the robot\ntrajectory remains contextually appropriate and sensitive to the ongoing\nenvironment. This balance between task efficiency and social appropriateness\nenhances context-aware human-robot interactions in domestic settings.

In order to meet the time-varying\nrequirements of tasks and complete multiple tasks efficiently under resource\nconstraints, in this paper, we propose a UAV swarm based multi-task FL\nframework, where ground emergency vehicles (EVs) collaborate with UAVs to\naccomplish multiple tasks efficiently under constrained energy and bandwidth\nresources.

Additionally,\nwe propose a task affinity (TA) metric to capture the dynamic correlation among\ntasks, thereby promoting task knowledge sharing to accelerate training and\nimprove the generalization ability of the model in different scenarios.

Therefore, it is both\nnecessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies.\nAlthough there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on enterprise\nrisk analysis from the perspective of Finance and Management, these surveys\nintroduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack recent advances in\nenterprise financial risk analysis. In contrast, this paper attempts to provide\na systematic literature survey of enterprise risk analysis approaches from Big\nData perspective, which reviews more than 250 representative articles in the\npast almost 50 years (from 1968 to 2023). To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first and only survey work on enterprise financial risk from Big Data\nperspective. Specifically, this survey connects and systematizes the existing\nenterprise financial risk studies, i.e. to summarize and interpret the\nproblems, methods, and spotlights in a comprehensive way. In particular, we\nfirst introduce the issues of enterprise financial risks in terms of their\ntypes,granularity, intelligence, and evaluation metrics, and summarize the\ncorresponding representative works. Then, we compare the analysis methods used\nto learn enterprise financial risk, and finally summarize the spotlights of the\nmost representative works. Our goal is to clarify current cutting-edge research\nand its possible future directions to model enterprise risk, aiming to fully\nunderstand the mechanisms of enterprise risk generation and contagion.\n","authors":["Huaming Du","Xingyan Chen","Yu Zhao","Qing Li","Fuzhen Zhuang","Fuji Ren","Gang Kou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14997v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09106v1","updated":"2025-03-12T06:46:32Z","published":"2025-03-12T06:46:32Z","title":"Freeze and Cluster: A Simple Baseline for Rehearsal-Free Continual\n  Category Discovery","summary":"  This paper addresses the problem of Rehearsal-Free Continual Category\nDiscovery (RF-CCD), which focuses on continuously identifying novel class by\nleveraging knowledge from labeled data.

To address these challenges, we introduce DistJoin, a join\ncardinality estimator based on efficient distribution prediction using\nmulti-autoregressive models.

In this work, we propose\nCleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework\nintroducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive\napproaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct\nfeature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP)\nprojection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies\nthroughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on\npseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without\nexplicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary\nself-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic\nknowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for\n2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up\nto 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing\nthe effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy\n","authors":["Hariprasath Govindarajan","Maciej K.

However, engineers,\npublic planners and decision-makers in other fields seem to employ solution\nstrategies that do not fall into either field, i.e., strategies such as robust\ndesign and contingency planning. In addition, identical strategies appear in\nseveral fields and disciplines, pointing to an important shared toolkit.\n  The focus of this paper is to develop a systematic understanding of such\nstrategies and develop a framework to better employ them in decision making and\nrisk management. The paper finds more than 110 examples of such strategies and\nthis approach to risk is termed RDOT: Risk-reducing Design and Operations\nToolkit. RDOT strategies fall into six broad categories: structural, reactive,\nformal, adversarial, multi-stage and positive. RDOT strategies provide an\nefficient response even to radical uncertainty or unknown unknowns that are\nchallenging to address with probabilistic methods. RDOT could be incorporated\ninto decision theory using workflows, multi-objective optimization and\nmulti-attribute utility theory.\n  Overall, RDOT represents an overlooked class of versatile responses to\nuncertainty.

This position paper argues that LRMs\nsubstantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT\nparadigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires\ncontextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify\nthree foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve\nambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over\ncross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural\nintentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,\naudience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can\nperform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential\nerrors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better\nrobustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various\nscenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level\ntranslation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that\ndemonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several\ninteresting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as\nwell as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and\ninference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation\nsystems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents\ncapable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text.

In the first few-shot stage, the model generates several prior response\ntokens via standard ICL while concurrently extracting the ICL vector that\nstores the task function from the separator token representation. In the\nfollowing zero-shot stage, this ICL vector guides the model to generate\nresponses without further demonstrations.Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour PICA not only surpasses vanilla ICL but also achieves comparable\nperformance to other alignment tuning methods.

This\nunexpected property is attributed to the network's so-called implicit bias,\nwhich describes its propensity to converge to solutions that generalize\neffectively, among the many possible that correctly label the training data.\nThe aim of our research is to explore this bias from a new perspective,\nfocusing on how non-linear activation functions contribute to shaping it.\nFirst, we introduce a reparameterization which removes a continuous weight\nrescaling symmetry. Second, in the kernel regime, we leverage this\nreparameterization to generalize recent findings that relate shallow Neural\nNetworks to the Radon transform, deriving an explicit formula for the implicit\nbias induced by a broad class of activation functions.

Finally, in the adaptive regime, we demonstrate the\nexistence of local dynamical attractors that facilitate the formation of\nclusters of hyperplanes where the input to a neuron's activation function is\nzero, yielding alignment between many neurons' response functions.

However, optimizing proxy\nrewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function\nceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect\nto the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have\nbeen impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this\ngap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation\nbetween proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"reference\npolicy\" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition\ncaptures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including\nin reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in\nneural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered\narrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take\ninto account the weight scaling symmetries of $\\ReLU$ networks, and the weight\nsign flipping symmetries of $\\sin$ or $\\Tanh$ networks. In this paper, we\nextend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of\npermutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating\nscaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these\nscaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and\ninvariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group\nEquivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion\nof the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters\ncompared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's\nefficiency.

SIC causes\nthe system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing\nsampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields\nfor generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed\nGenerative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for\nnear-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a\nnuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat\nBath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to\nhigh-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional\nHB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers\nfrom a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation\nalways occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and\nhigher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not\nconsidered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a\npart of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those\nresidual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show\nthat the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher\nthan state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for\n128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.\n","authors":["Ankur Singha","Elia Cellini","Kim A.

While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively\nexplored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their\napplication to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms\nof inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based\non observations.

Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show\nthat ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both\ntightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose\nclothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant\ntightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in\none-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate\nstrong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes,\nloose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics.

However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs\nfunction and whether they could serve as \"per-token\" hallucination indicators,\nwhich is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an\nin-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and\ndiscover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token\nindicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode\nuniversal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating\nthat there exist \"generic truthful directions\" shared by various LVLMs. Based\non these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt)\nthat first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies\ntruthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding.

Second, in the kernel regime, we leverage this\nreparameterization to generalize recent findings that relate shallow Neural\nNetworks to the Radon transform, deriving an explicit formula for the implicit\nbias induced by a broad class of activation functions. Specifically, by\nutilizing the connection between the Radon transform and the Fourier transform,\nwe interpret the kernel regime's inductive bias as minimizing a spectral\nseminorm that penalizes high-frequency components, in a manner dependent on the\nactivation function. Finally, in the adaptive regime, we demonstrate the\nexistence of local dynamical attractors that facilitate the formation of\nclusters of hyperplanes where the input to a neuron's activation function is\nzero, yielding alignment between many neurons' response functions.

However, optimizing proxy\nrewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function\nceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect\nto the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have\nbeen impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this\ngap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation\nbetween proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"reference\npolicy\" that breaks down under optimization.

To address these issues, we propose a\ndecentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework,\nclients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other.

To this end, this paper proposes a novel\nphysics-encoded deep learning network, named PeMTFLN, to model the nonlinear\nvehicle platoon dynamics. Specifically, an analyzable parameters encoded\ncomputational graph (APeCG) is designed to guide the platoon to respond to the\ndriving behavior of the lead vehicle while ensuring local stability.

While fine-grained partial-sum quantization has been\nstudied to lower ADC resolution effectively, weight granularity, which limits\noverall partial-sum quantized accuracy, remains underexplored. This work\naddresses these challenges by aligning weight and partial-sum quantization\ngranularities at the column-wise level. Our method improves accuracy while\nmaintaining dequantization overhead, simplifies training by removing two-stage\nprocesses, and ensures robustness to memory cell variations via independent\ncolumn-wise scale factors.

We propose a parallel decoding\nsequence-to-sequence vision-language model, trained with a Query-CTC loss, that\nmarginalizes over multiple inference paths in the decoder. This allows us to\nmodel the joint distribution of tokens, rather than restricting to conditional\ndistribution as in an autoregressive model. The resulting model, NARVL,\nachieves performance on-par with its state-of-the-art autoregressive\ncounterpart, but is faster at inference time, reducing from the linear\ncomplexity associated with the sequential generation of tokens to a paradigm of\nconstant time joint inference.\n","authors":["Kunyu Shi","Qi Dong","Luis Goncalves","Zhuowen Tu","Stefano Soatto"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02249v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted to CVPR 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05336v3","updated":"2025-03-13T00:09:08Z","published":"2025-03-07T11:23:48Z","title":"Toward an Evaluation Science for Generative AI Systems","summary":"  There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the\nperformance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment\ncontexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly\nused static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits\nrarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for\ngenerative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system\nsafety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable\ninsights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields,\nincluding transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In\nparticular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable\nto real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation\ninstitutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline\na concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI\nsystems.\n","authors":["Laura Weidinger","Inioluwa Deborah Raji","Hanna Wallach","Margaret Mitchell","Angelina Wang","Olawale Salaudeen","Rishi Bommasani","Deep Ganguli","Sanmi Koyejo","William Isaac"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05336v3.pdf","comment":"First two authors contributed equally to this work"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09910v1","updated":"2025-03-13T00:01:36Z","published":"2025-03-13T00:01:36Z","title":"eXpLogic: Explaining Logic Types and Patterns in DiffLogic Networks","summary":"  Constraining deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn individual logic types per\nnode, as performed using the DiffLogic network architecture, opens the door to\nmodel-specific explanation techniques that quell the complexity inherent to\nDNNs. Inspired by principles of circuit analysis from computer engineering,\nthis work presents an algorithm (eXpLogic) for producing saliency maps which\nexplain input patterns that activate certain functions. The eXpLogic\nexplanations: (1) show the exact set of inputs responsible for a decision,\nwhich helps interpret false negative and false positive predictions, (2)\nhighlight common input patterns that activate certain outputs, and (3) help\nreduce the network size to improve class-specific inference. To evaluate the\neXpLogic saliency map, we introduce a metric that quantifies how much an input\nchanges before switching a model's class prediction (the SwitchDist) and use\nthis metric to compare eXpLogic against the Vanilla Gradients (VG) and\nIntegrated Gradient (IG) methods. Generally, we show that eXpLogic saliency\nmaps are better at predicting which inputs will change the class score. These\nmaps help reduce the network size and inference times by 87\\% and 8\\%,\nrespectively, while having a limited impact (-3.8\\%) on class-specific\npredictions. The broader value of this work to machine learning is in\ndemonstrating how certain DNN architectures promote explainability, which is\nrelevant to healthcare, defense, and law.\n","authors":["Stephen Wormald","David Koblah","Matheus Kunzler Maldaner","Domenic Forte","Damon L.
